..> Jest and Supertest are both popular testing tools, but they serve different purposes and are often used together in the context of testing HTTP APIs and applications.

.> Jest is a JavaScript testing framework commonly used for unit and integration
 testing in JavaScript/TypeScript applications.

..> Jest is often used for unit testing, integration testing, and mocking JavaScript
 code.


..> Supertest is a testing library specifically designed for testing HTTP APIs (RESTful APIs). It provides an easy-to-use interface to make HTTP requests and assert responses from your API endpoints.


..> It is typically used in conjunction with a framework like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine 
to perform integration testing on HTTP requests


JEST :
==========>
Jest:

..> Jest is used to test JavaScript code at any level: unit, integration, or end-to-end testing. You can test functions, modules, and components.
..> It can be used for testing React components, Node.js functions, and much more.


SUPER-TEST:
============>

..> Supertest is specifically used for testing HTTP requests in your API, often in combination with a backend framework like Express or Fastify.
..> It’s ideal for writing tests for RESTful APIs.






Installation of JEST:


npm install --save-dev jest
npm install jest --save-dev

..> By default, Jest doesn't support import unless your project is set up to handle ES modules.




ex: For the jest testing:
================================>
sum.js
=======>



sum-test.js

Installation of SuperTest:

npm install --save-dev supertest



For the superTesting:
==================================> 
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./app'); // Express app

describe('GET /users', () => {
  it('should return a 200 status and user data', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get('/users');
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body).toEqual(expect.arrayContaining([expect.objectContaining({ id: expect.any(Number), name: expect.any(String) })]));
  });
});


data:
=========>
Use Supertest for:
Testing endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) of your API.
Testing API behaviors like status codes, headers, and response bodies.
Writing integration tests for your server or backend application.

jest with the SuperTest :
==============================>
In many cases, you will use Jest and Supertest together for testing an API:

Jest will be your test runner and handle assertions, mockings, and reporting.
Supertest will be used to send HTTP requests to the server and check the API's responses.

==============================================================================================>==============================================================================================>==============================================================================================>








const app = express()

app.use(express.json())
app.post('/users', async (req, res) => {
  const { password, username } = req.body
  if (!password || !username) {
    res.sendStatus(400)
    return
  }

  res.send({ userId: 0 })
})

export default app


...> :

expect(response.body.userId).toBeDefined(); means the test checks that userId is defined in the response (it checks if it's not undefined).
ex:
test("response has event data", async () => {
  const response = await request(app).post("/users").send({
    username: "username",
    password: "password"
  });

  // Check if response body has "name"
  expect(response.body.name).toBeDefined();
});


...> If you want to check for multiple fields in the response, you could write multiple assertions:

ex:

test("response has event data", async () => {
  const response = await request(app).post("/users").send({
    username: "username",
    password: "password"
  });

  // Check if specific fields are defined in the response
  expect(response.body.name).toBeDefined();
  expect(response.body.amount).toBeDefined();
  expect(response.body.eventName).toBeDefined();
});


..............>
expect(response.body.eventName).toBeDefined();
  expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('name');
  expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('amount');
=======>
In this case, you're testing both for the existence of important fields (toBeDefined()) and for the presence of other fields (toHaveProperty()).

Post scnario:

// Mocking your model and bcrypt
jest.mock('../../models/logicD'); // Mock the LoginD model
jest.mock('bcryptjs');
jest.mock('jsonwebtoken');


const LoginD = require('../../models/logicD');
        LoginD.findOne = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(mockUser);
        bcrypt.compare = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(true);  // M


In this code snippet, you're mocking two functions for testing purposes using Jest.

LoginD.findOne = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(mockUser);

LoginD.findOne is likely a database query function (or a method on a model), which is being replaced with a mock function.
jest.fn() creates a mock function, and mockResolvedValue(mockUser) ensures that this mock function will return a resolved promise with the value of mockUser whenever it's called.
So, when LoginD.findOne() is called during the test, it will return mockUser as if it was fetched from the database.
bcrypt.compare = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(true);

bcrypt.compare is a function that is used to compare a hashed password with a plaintext password (typically used for authentication).
jest.fn() again creates a mock function, and mockResolvedValue(true) ensures that this mock function will return a resolved promise with the value true.
So, whenever bcrypt.compare() is called in the test, it will return true, simulating a successful password match.

..> beforeEach() is used as a hook in test setups (often in unit or integration tests), specifically in testing frameworks like Mocha, Jest, or others

..> It's used, particularly when you're dealing with routes that require authentication (like using a token with a Bearer and Authorization header).


..> The beforeEach() function is part of the testing framework that runs before each individual test in a suite. It's commonly used for setting up the environment, initializing variables, 

...> 

ex:

beforeEach(() => {
    app.set('req', { user: mockUser });
});



...> This ensures that before every test runs, the application’s req object is set up with a mock authenticated user (mockUser).


...> If your routes require an authenticated user, it's essential that this setup happens for every test that involves authentication, so each test gets a consistent state.


...> 
Example in Authentication Context :

..> In an API with routes requiring authentication (like using tokens or session cookies), beforeEach() would help you set up the mock authentication data for every test that needs it.

...>


ex:
beforeEach(() => {
    // Mock the user that would be authenticated
    const mockUser = { id: '60d9f1b8b7f8d02c4b1c95f6', name: 'John Doe' };
    
    // Mock the Authorization header
    app.set('req', { 
        user: mockUser, 
        headers: { 
            Authorization: 'Bearer your-jwt-token-here'
        } 
    });
});

..> Simulate Authentication for Each Test: If your routes rely on authentication, you need to simulate the presence of a user (like attaching a user object to req) for every test where authentication is needed. This is why you set req.user inside beforeEach().


NOTE: app.set('req', { user: mockUser }); is not about setting the ID in the URL or setting an Authorization header. Instead, it's simulating an authenticated user for every request in your tests.

FASTIFY TESTING :
=====================>

...> The issue you're facing with TypeError: app.address is not a function is happening because supertest expects an Express-like application that exposes an address method, but Fastify does not have this method.

Fastify's API is different from Express, and because of this difference, the integration with supertest needs to be handled differently.



...> Instead of using supertest with request(app) directly, you need to use Fastify's inject method for making requests in your tests. inject simulates HTTP requests and works seamlessly with Fastify, making it a better choice for testing Fastify apps.

Steps:
Replace supertest with inject:

Use Fastify's built-in inject function to make requests in your tests.
inject allows you to send HTTP requests to your Fastify instance without actually starting a server.

..> No need for .listen() and .close():

You don't need to start the server with .listen() in your test setup. Instead, Fastify handles the HTTP requests through inject.


=====================================================>=====================================================>=====================================================>=====================================================>vv=====================================================>=====================================================>=====================================================>=====================================================>

..> Users.findOne.mockResolvedValue(null);
This line is setting up a mock (fake) version of the findOne function from the Users model. Instead of actually going to a database and trying to find a user, it's making it always return null (meaning no user is found).


...> const mockSave = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({});
This creates a mock version of the save function. jest.fn() is used to create a fake function, and .mockResolvedValue({}) means when save is called, it will return an empty object {} as if the save operation was successful.

....> Users.prototype.save = mockSave;
This line replaces the real save method in the Users model with the fake one (mockSave) that was just created. So, now, when we try to call save on a user object, it will use the mocked version that returns an empty object.

...>


hash passwords in the Testing :
=====================================>

jest.spyOn(bcrypt, 'compare')
jest.spyOn is a function that allows us to "spy" on or track calls to an existing function. In this case, it's spying on the compare function inside the bcrypt library.
bcrypt is a library used for hashing passwords and comparing them to hashed values.
'compare' is the name of the function inside bcrypt that compares a plain text password to a hashed one.
When you use jest.spyOn(bcrypt, 'compare'), it means you want to monitor or change how bcrypt.compare behaves during the test. You're telling Jest, "Look at how this function is being used."

2. .mockResolvedValue(false)
.mockResolvedValue(false) tells Jest to change the behavior of the compare function. Instead of actually comparing passwords, you are making it always return false.
Returning false means that the function is simulating the situation where the passwords do not match.
Putting it all together:
You're spying on bcrypt.compare to control how it behaves during testing.
Instead of performing the actual password comparison, you tell it to always return false, which simulates that the passwords don’t match (even if they might).





A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown. Try running with --detectOpenHandles to find leaks. Active timers can also cause this, ensure that .unref() was called on them.

======================================================================>======================================================================>vv======================================================================>======================================================================>======================================================================>

The error you're seeing is likely because you used toBeEqual, which is not a valid matcher in Jest. The correct matcher is toEqual.

Here's the key difference:
toEqual:

Purpose: Used to compare the values of objects or arrays, checking that they are deeply equal. This means it checks that the values within the object or array match, not just the reference.
When to Use: Use toEqual when comparing objects, arrays, or any other value where you need to check that the contents are the same, not just the reference.
javascript
Copy
const obj1 = { name: 'John', age: 25 };
const obj2 = { name: 'John', age: 25 };

expect(obj1).toEqual(obj2);  // Passes because the values are the same
toBe:

Purpose: Used for comparing primitive values (like numbers, strings, booleans) or checking if two variables refer to the same object reference.
When to Use: Use toBe for strict equality checks or when comparing primitives.
javascript
Copy
const num1 = 5;
const num2 = 5;

expect(num1).toBe(num2);  // Passes because both numbers are the same value
toBeEqual:

Purpose: This is not a valid Jest matcher. It was probably a typo, and that's why you're getting an error. Jest does not have a toBeEqual matcher.

Snapshots: Jest has a feature called snapshot testing, where you can save the output of a component or function at a certain point in time and compare it to future runs to ensure the output hasn't changed unexpectedly.
0 total: You have no snapshots in your test suite. This could mean that you're not using snapshot testing in your tests, or it could indicate that you didn't set up any snapshot tests.

2 Test Suites Failed means that both of your test files (which are each considered a "test suite") have encountered failures.
2 total indicates you have two test files in total.
Each of these test files (e.g., test1.js, test2.js) represents a "test suite" in Jest. The fact that both test suites have failed means that all the tests within both of these files failed to pass.

Breakdown:
Test Suites: This corresponds to your test files (in your case, there are 2 test files).
Both of the test files (test suites) failed in this case.



======================================================================>======================================================================>vv======================================================================>======================================================================>======================================================================>
To run the test cases and get a tabular result with the percentage of successfully passed tests and which files are covered, you need to make a few updates and configurations. Here’s how to achieve this:

Steps to Set Up Test Coverage Reporting
Install Necessary Packages

You've already installed jest and supertest, but for test coverage and reporting, you'll need to ensure that jest is configured to track coverage and output in a format like lcov (which can be read by tools like Coveralls, or displayed in the terminal).

You can add jest's coverage configuration in the package.json file, and you'll need to install a package to view results in tabular form.

Update package.json for Jest Configuration

Add a Jest configuration in your package.json file that enables coverage reporting. You can also specify the coverageReporters as text and lcov to get both tabular output and detailed reports (LCOV for HTML and text for the terminal).

Update the scripts and jest configuration section as follows:

{
  "name": "fastify-role",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "dev": "nodemon app.js",
    "test": "jest --coverage",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch --coverage"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",
    "fastify": "^3.29.0",
    "joi": "^17.13.3",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.9.5",
    "nodemon": "^3.1.9"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.26.7",
    "babel-jest": "^29.7.0",
    "jest": "^29.7.0",
    "supertest": "^7.0.0"
  },
  "jest": {
    "collectCoverage": true,
    "coverageDirectory": "./coverage",
    "coverageReporters": [
      "text",
      "lcov"
    ],
    "testEnvironment": "node",
    "transform": {
      "^.+\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$": "babel-jest"
    }
  }
}

==========>
Explanation of Changes:

"collectCoverage": true: This ensures that Jest collects coverage information during test runs.
"coverageDirectory": "./coverage": The directory where Jest will output the coverage report.
"coverageReporters": ["text", "lcov"]: This will produce two types of reports:
Text format (will be shown in the terminal as a summary).
LCOV format (can be used to view coverage in a more detailed way in HTML, useful for services like Coveralls).
"testEnvironment": "node": Ensures Jest uses the node environment, which is typical for testing server-side code.
"transform": Uses babel-jest to handle transforming JavaScript files.
Running Tests with Coverage

Now, when you run your tests using the command:
npm run test


================>
Run the tests.
Output the test results in the terminal, including the percentage of tests passed and the files that were covered.
The coverage directory will be created, and it will contain an lcov-report folder where you can open an HTML file (e.g., index.html) to view a detailed tabular coverage report.

======================================================================>======================================================================>vv======================================================================>======================================================================>======================================================================>





======================================================================>======================================================================>vv======================================================================>======================================================================>======================================================================>

Optional: Coverage in HTML Format

If you want to see a more detailed and interactive report, after running the tests, open the coverage/lcov-report/index.html in a browser. This will provide you with a full HTML report that includes which lines of code were covered or missed.

Additional Configuration for Jest

If you prefer specific configurations for individual test cases or coverage thresholds (e.g., fail the build if the coverage falls below 80%), you can add to the jest configuration:


"jest": {
  "collectCoverage": true,
  "coverageDirectory": "./coverage",
  "coverageReporters": ["text", "lcov"],
  "coverageThreshold": {
    "global": {
      "branches": 80,
      "functions": 80,
      "lines": 80,
      "statements": 80
    }
  }
}

...> This will enforce that your coverage does not drop below 80% globally.
======================================================================>======================================================================>vv======================================================================>======================================================================>======================================================================>
2. Use concurrently to Run Both Server and Tests Simultaneously
You can use the concurrently package to run both nodemon and jest in parallel within a single terminal.

Install concurrently:
bash
Copy code
npm install concurrently --save-dev


Modify package.json to include the concurrent command:
json
Copy code
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "concurrently \"npm run dev\" \"npm run test\"",
    "dev": "nodemon app.js",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
With this setup:

npm run start will run both the nodemon server and the jest tests concurrently in the same terminal.
npm run dev will run the server with nodemon.
npm run test will run the tests with Jest.
Run both in parallel:
To run both, execute:

bash
Copy code
npm run start
This will run both nodemon and Jest in parallel.

3. Use tmux or screen (Terminal Multiplexers)
If you're comfortable with terminal multiplexers, you can use tmux or screen to split your terminal into multiple panes, so you can run the server in one pane and the tests in another.

For example, with tmux:

Open a terminal window and run tmux.
Split the terminal horizontally or vertically (e.g., Ctrl-b % for vertical).
In one pane, run npm run dev (this starts your server).
In the other pane, run npm run jest to run your tests.
4. Use npm run test in the Background
You can also run your tests in the background while keeping the server running:

bash
Copy code
npm run jest &   # This runs the tests in the background.
This allows you to keep the terminal free for other tasks while the tests are running in the background.

======================================================================>======================================================================>vv======================================================================>======================================================================>======================================================================>
npm test -- --detectOpenHandles

======================================================================>======================================================================>vv======================================================================>======================================================================>======================================================================>


3. Use an In-Memory Database for Tests
Another option is to use an in-memory MongoDB instance for running tests. This can be done using the mongodb-memory-server package. This package will run a MongoDB instance purely in-memory, which can be more efficient and prevent the need for a real database.

First, install the mongodb-memory-server package:

bash
Copy code
npm install mongodb-memory-server --save-dev
Then, update your test setup to use it:

javascript
Copy code
import { MongoMemoryServer } from 'mongodb-memory-server';
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

let mongoServer;

beforeAll(async () => {
    mongoServer = await MongoMemoryServer.create();
    const mongoUri = mongoServer.getUri();
    await mongoose.connect(mongoUri, {
        useNewUrlParser: true,
        useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });
});

afterAll(async () => {
    await mongoose.connection.close(); // Close the in-memory MongoDB connection
    await mongoServer.stop(); // Stop the in-memory MongoDB server
});
4. Check the afterAll Cleanup
In your afterAll function, you may be trying to close the MongoDB connection or app server, but if there was an issue in connecting to the database earlier, it could lead to mongoose.connection being undefined. By mocking the connection properly, this can be avoided.

Here's an updated version of your test file with a mock for mongoose.connection.close:

javascript
Copy code
import fastify from 'fastify';
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import app from '../../app.js';
import request from 'supertest';

// Mock mongoose connection and methods
jest.mock('mongoose', () => {
    const actualMongoose = jest.requireActual('mongoose');
    return {
        ...actualMongoose,
        connection: {
            close: jest.fn(), // Mocking the `close` method of the connection
        },
    };
});

// Mocking the Users model
jest.mock('../../models/Users.js', () => {
    return {
        findOne: jest.fn(),
        prototype: {
            save: jest.fn(),
        },
    };
});

import Users from '../../models/Users.js';

describe('POST /register', () => {
    let server;

    beforeAll(async () => {
        server = await app.listen(0);
    });

    afterAll(async () => {
        await app.close(); // Close Fastify server
        await mongoose.connection.close(); // Close mocked mongoose connection
    });

    beforeEach(() => {
        jest.clearAllMocks();
    });

    it('should register a new user successfully with valid data', async () => {
        Users.findOne = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(null);

        Users.prototype.save = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
            _id: 'mocked-user-id',
            username: 'Testuser',
            email: 'Testuser@gmail.com',
            role: 'user',
        });

        const response = await request(app.server)
            .post('/auth/register')
            .send({
                username: 'Testuser',
                email: 'Testuser@gmail.com',
                password: 'Password@123',
                role: 'user',
            });

        expect(response.status).toBe(201);
        expect(response.body.message).toBe('user created successfully');
        expect(Users.findOne).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ username: 'Testuser' });
        expect(Users.prototype.save).toHaveBeenCalled();
    });
});
Recap:
Mocking mongoose.connection.close() to avoid the TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'close').
Optional: You can use mongodb-memory-server to run tests against an in-memory database.
This should resolve the TypeError and allow your tests to run smoothly.
